Explanation:

Menu System:

The showMenu() function displays the options: Start Quiz or Exit.

We use fgets(STDIN) to read user input, and trim() is used to remove any leading/trailing spaces.

The program continues to show the menu in a while(true) loop, which ensures the program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

Quiz Logic:

The startQuiz() function contains an array of questions and answers. Each question is an associative array with keys 'question' and 'answer'.

The program then loops through each question, presenting the user with the question and checking if their input matches the correct answer (case-insensitive).

For each correct answer, the score increments by 1, and at the end of the quiz, the final score is displayed.

Input Handling:

trim(fgets(STDIN)) is used to read user input from the terminal and remove any unwanted spaces.

The strtolower() function ensures the input is compared in a case-insensitive way.

Program Flow:

The loop will continue until the user chooses to exit (option 2 in the menu).

If the user enters an invalid menu choice, the program will prompt them to select either option 1 or 2.
